# Book Tracker ðŸ“š

A Python project to track and analyze personal reading habits.  
It follows an **ELT pipeline** (Extract â†’ Load â†’ Transform â†’ Report) and generates summaries about books read over time.  

---

## Features
- Extracts new entries from an Excel database, hosted on OneDrive and synced locally.
- Loads and consolidates updates into a CSV database.
- Transforms the data to calculate metrics like:
  - Reading duration (days per book).
  - Pages per day.
- Generates a text-based report with statistics:
  - Total books read overall and in the current year.
  - Ongoing and dropped books.
  - Average reading pace.
  - Top-3 books (by score).
  - Last completed book.

**Notes**

- The `database/` folder is excluded from version control for privacy reasons.
- A small fake database (`simulated_database/`) is provided to show the structure of the data I used.
- The file I retrieve data from is synced locally through OneDrive.
- I created this project to synchronize changes from an Excel file stored online and maintain an up-to-date local backup. I saw it as a good opportunity to apply ELT principles, which is why I designed this specific solution instead of opting for a simpler approach.
